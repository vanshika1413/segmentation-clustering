# Segmentation and Clustering Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to explore various segmentation and clustering techniques using a diverse dataset. The main goal is to develop models that can effectively segment and cluster data, providing insights into underlying patterns and classifications.

## File Descriptions
- `Welcome.py`: Introduction and setup script for the project, including necessary imports and initial configurations.
- `page2_UncleanData.py`: Scripts to handle and visualize unclean data, preparing for the cleaning process.
- `page3_CleanData.py`: Implements data cleaning techniques to improve data quality and prepare it for modeling.
- `page4_Modelling.py`: Contains the modeling process using various clustering algorithms to analyze the data.
- `page5_SentimentAnalysis.py`: Conducts sentiment analysis on clustered data to extract insights and trends.
- `MSA_Proj.csv`: The dataset used for segmentation and clustering, comprising various attributes essential for the analysis.

## Installation and Setup
To run this project, you need to install Python and the following packages:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```
Clone this repository, navigate to the project directory, and run the scripts in the following order:
```bash
python Welcome.py
python page2_UncleanData.py
python page3_CleanData.py
python page4_Modelling.py
python page5_SentimentAnalysis.py
```

## Usage
Each script is designed to be run sequentially to follow the flow from data loading and cleaning to analysis and modeling. Comments within the scripts provide additional guidance on their specific functions and usage.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
